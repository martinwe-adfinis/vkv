.SH NAME

vkv - minimalistic commandline interface for getting KV secrets from HashiCorp
Vault

.\" ============================================================================
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBvkv -h\fR
.br
\fBvkv\fR [\fIoptions\fR...] \fIcommand\fR [\fIargs\fR...]

.\" ============================================================================
.SH DESCRIPTION

vkv allows fetching secrets from a HashiCorp Vault key-value (KV) store in a way
similar to \fBpass\fR(1).

vkv itself does not store any secrets, but it allows "bookmarking" paths to
secrets in the KV store, for easier reuse (see \fBFILES\fR below).

.SS Options

.TP 4
\fB-d\fR
Print debug messages to \fBstderr\fR during execution (e.g. JSON responses).

.TP
\fB-h\fR
Print a help message and exit.

.SS Commands

vkv's functionality is split up into multiple commands, each described in this
section. In addition to the options described below, each command also accepts
\fB-h\fR for showing a command-specific help message.

.TP 4
\fBlist\fR
List all bookmarked KV paths. The bookmark file is described in the \fBFILES\fR
section below.

.TP
\fBshow\fR [\fB-c\fR] \fIkvpath\fR \fIfield\fR [\fIfilter\fR...]
Show the content of a secret's field in the KV store. \fIkvpath\fR denotes the
secret's path; it is described in the \fBKV PATHS\fR section below. \fIfield\fR
denotes the field to be selected within the secret. The optional \fIfilter\fR
arguments verify that the other fields in the secret contain expected values;
the format is described in the \fBFILTER FORMAT\fR section below. If \fB-c\fR is
passed, the secret is copied to the X11 clipboard instead of being printed to
\fBstdout\fR; see the section \fBCLIPBOARD\fR below for more details.

.\" ============================================================================
.SH KV PATHS

Some commands take the KV path of a secret, which must be formated as follows:

.RS 4
\fImount\fB/\fIpath\fR
.RE

i.e. the first element of the path is split and interpreted as the KV v2
mountpoint of the KV store. The remainder is taken as a path within that store.

.\" ============================================================================
.SH FILTER FORMAT

A filter (used for the \fBshow\fR command) is of the following form:

.RS 4
\fIkey\fB=\fIvalue\fR
.RE

This instructs \fBshow\fR to verify that the field \fIkey\fR contains the value
\fIvalue\fR and error out if the found value differs.

This allows for example to ensure that a \fBusername\fR field contains the
expected username for a requested \fBpassword\fR field. The following example
shows a case where we want the password for a \fBweb.example.net\fR login, but
only if the username is \fBwebmaster\fR, as expected:

.RS 4
\fBvkv show mykvstore/service/web.example.net/admin password username=webmaster\fR
.RE

.\" ============================================================================
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The following environment variables influence the behaviour of vkv:

.TP 4
\fBUSER\fR
Username on the system. If unset, \fBid\fR(1p) is used to determine the
username.

.TP
\fBHOME\fR
Location of user files. If unset, the user's \fBpasswd\fR(5) entry is used to
determine the home directory.

.TP
\fBXDG_CONFIG_HOME\fR
Location of user configuration files (see also \fBFILES\fR below). If unset, the
default \fB~/.config\fR is used in accordance with the XDG base directory
specification.

.TP
\fBPASSWORD_STORE_X_SELECTION\fR
X11 selection to be used for storing the secret with \fBshow -c\fR. Possible
values are described in \fBxclip\fR(1), for the \fB-selection\fR option.

.TP
\fBVAULT_ADDR\fR
Address to the HashiCorp Vault instance containing the secret.

.PP
Note that other \fBVAULT_â€¦\fR environment variables may need to be set,
depending on your local HashiCorp Vault setup.

.\" ============================================================================
.SH FILES

.TP 4
\fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fB/vkv/paths\fR
"Booksmarks" file containing a list of KV paths. This is listed by the
\fBlist\fR command, which is also consumed by helper utilities like
\fBvkvmenu\fR(1). Each line must contain the arguments for a \fBshow\fR
invocation. Empty lines and lines starting with \fB#\fR are ignored.

.\" ============================================================================
.SH LIMITATIONS

This utility is very minimalistic and not optimised for manual use. Instead,
users are advised to use the \fBvkvmenu\fR(1) utility, an interactive menu for
selecting secrets similar to \fBpassmenu\fR.

.\" ============================================================================
.SH SEE ALSO

\fBvkvmenu\fR(1), \fBpass\fR(1) (\fBpassmenu\fR), \fBxclip\fR(1)
